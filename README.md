# pyexperimenthistory

PyExperimentHistory is a project which helps you maintain a history of all the experiments you run within a program. Running Deep Learning applications forces us to change parameters constantly and run long running applications.

PyExperimentHistory provides an easy to use api which can be integrated into applications to store images, history of parameter values etc.
